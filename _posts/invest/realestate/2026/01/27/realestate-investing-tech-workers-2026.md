## 1. Why Real Estate for Tech Workers?

### Advantages for Tech Professionals

**1. High Income Capability**
- Tech salaries ($100,000-$300,000/year) enable large down payments
- Strong debt-to-income ratio for mortgage approval
- Ability to afford premium properties

**2. Location Independence**
- Remote work allows living anywhere
- Tech hubs (Austin, Raleigh, Denver) have strong real estate markets
- Lower property prices compared to San Francisco/New York

**3. Passive Income Potential**

- REITs pay dividends (up to 8% yield)
- Property appreciation builds equity over time

### Disadvantages

**1. Management Headaches**
- Dealing with tenants (repairs, complaints)

- Unexpected maintenance costs (HVAC, roof, appliances)

**2. Capital Intensity**
- Requires large down payment ($50,000-$100,000)
- Debt leverage increases financial risk
- Property is illiquid (hard to sell quickly)

## 2. REIT Investing (Passive Real Estate)

### What are REITs?

REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are companies that own income-generating real estate.

### Why REITs Work for Tech Workers

**Benefits:**
- **Passive Income:** No property management
- **Dividends:** Monthly/quarterly dividend payments
- **Liquidity:** Easily buy/sell shares on stock market
- **Diversification:** Own commercial, industrial, residential, healthcare
- **Tax Efficiency:** Dividends taxed at 15% long-term rate

**Top REITs for 2026**

| REIT | Ticker | Sector | Dividend Yield | Price | 5-Year Return |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------|---------------|
| **Vanguard Real Estate ETF** | VNQ | Broad REIT | 3.8% | $110 | 40-50% |

## 8. Risk Management

### Risk 1: Market Risk

**Problem:** Property values can decline during recessions.

**Mitigation:**

- Maintain 6-month emergency fund in cash

### Risk 2: Liquidity Risk

**Problem:** Real estate is illiquid (hard to sell quickly).

**Mitigation:**
- Keep 20% of portfolio in cash/bonds
- Don't invest all wealth in real estate
- Have access to credit lines if needed

### Risk 3: Leverage Risk

**Problem:** Mortgages use debt (financial risk during income loss).

**Mitigation:**
- Use conservative debt-to-income ratio (< 30%)
- Fixed-rate mortgages to avoid rate increases
- Maintain 6-month expenses in cash
- Avoid interest-only mortgages

### Risk 4: Tenant Risk

**Problem:** Non-payment of rent, property damage, vacancy.

**Mitigation:**
- Hire property management company
- Require tenant insurance
- Screen tenants thoroughly (credit, background checks)
- Maintain 2-month reserve in property account

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Expenses

**Problem:** Not accounting for property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, vacancy.

**Solution:**
- Use "50% rule": Estimate expenses = 50% of rental income
- Add 10% buffer for unexpected costs
- Calculate cash flow after all expenses

### Mistake 2: Buying in Overheated Markets

**Problem:** Buying property at market peak (e.g., 2022-2023).

**Solution:**
- Wait for market correction (10-20% price drop)
- Focus on cash-flow positive properties (rent > mortgage)
- Avoid "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out)

### Mistake 3: Not Screening Tenants Properly

**Problem:** Bad tenants cause eviction, damages, lost rent.

**Solution:**
- Require credit score > 650
- Verify employment (last 2 years)
- Check references from previous landlords
- Require security deposit (1-2 months rent)

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Tax Implications

**Problem:** Not accounting for property taxes, capital gains tax, depreciation.

**Solution:**
- Consult tax professional before investing
- Understand Brazilian tax rules for foreign income
- Take advantage of NHR status (if moving to Portugal)
- Keep detailed records for all expenses

### Mistake 5: Not Having Exit Strategy

**Problem:** Forced to sell during market crash.

**Solution:**
- Know your "break-even" point
- Have 12-month emergency fund
- Plan exit scenarios (sell, refinance, hold)
- Maintain 6-month reserve in cash
