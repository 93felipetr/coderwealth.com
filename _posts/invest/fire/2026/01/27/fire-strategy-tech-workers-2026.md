## 1. What is FIRE?

FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early.

### Core Principles

1. **Financial Independence:** Your investment income covers all living expenses
2. **Retire Early:** Ability to stop working traditional jobs (in 20s, 30s, or 40s)
3. **Freedom from Time-for-Money:** You control your schedule completely

### For Tech Workers in 2026

**Advantages:**
- High Salaries: $100,000-$300,000/year for senior engineers
- Remote Work: Location independence (tax optimization)
- Passive Income Potential: SaaS, freelancing, side hustles
- Tech Skills: High leverage for creating income streams

### Challenges

- High Cost of Living in Tech Hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle)
- Lifestyle Creep: Income increases faster than lifestyle adjustments
- Market Risk: Portfolio volatility can delay FIRE
- Sequence of Returns Risk: Poor returns extend FIRE timeline

## 2. The FIRE Number

Your FIRE Number is the total portfolio value needed to support your lifestyle indefinitely without working.

### Simple Calculation

```
FIRE Number = (Annual Expenses × 25)
```

**Example:**
- Annual Expenses: $60,000
- FIRE Number: $60,000 × 25 = $1,500,000

### The 4% Rule Alternative

Instead of 25× expenses, use the 4% rule:

```
FIRE Number = (Annual Expenses) / 0.04
```

**Same Example:**
- Annual Expenses: $60,000
- FIRE Number: $60,000 / 0.04 = $1,500,000

The 4% rule is safer because it accounts for sequence of returns risk.

## 3. The 4% Rule Explained

The 4% rule is a safe withdrawal rate for retirement portfolios.

### Why 4%?

Based on historical market returns (S&P 500), a 4% withdrawal rate has a high probability (95%+) of portfolio survival over 30-year periods.

### Withdrawal Rate Risks

| Withdrawal Rate | Portfolio Survival (30 Years) |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| 3% | 99%+ |
| 4% | 95%+ (Safe Choice) |
| 5% | 80-90% (Moderate Risk) |
| 6%+ | <70% (High Risk) |

**Recommendation:** Start with 4% withdrawal rate, adjust based on market conditions.

## 4. Calculating Your FIRE Number

### Step 1: Track Annual Expenses

**Categories to Track:**
- Housing (Mortgage/Rent, Taxes, Insurance)
- Food (Groceries, Dining Out)
- Transportation (Car, Public Transit)
- Utilities (Electricity, Internet, Phone)
- Healthcare (Insurance, Out-of-Pocket)
- Personal Care (Clothing, Entertainment)
- Miscellaneous (Subscriptions, Hobbies)

**Tech Worker Specific Expenses:**
- **Home Office:** Desk, Chair, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse
- **Internet:** High-speed broadband ($50-100/month)
- **Software:** IDE Subscriptions, Cloud Services ($50-200/month)
- **Hardware:** Laptop upgrades every 3 years
- **Conferences:** Travel, Accommodation

### Step 2: Calculate Current Savings Rate

```
Current Savings Rate = (Gross Salary - Taxes - Expenses) / Gross Salary
```

**Example:**
- Gross Salary: $150,000/year
- Taxes: $45,000/year (30% effective rate)
- Expenses: $60,000/year
- Net Savings: $45,000/year
- Savings Rate: 45 / 150 = 30%

### Step 3: Project Timeline to FIRE

**Formula:**
```
Years to FIRE = (FIRE Number - Current Portfolio) / (Annual Savings × Investment Return)
```

**Example:**
- FIRE Number: $1,250,000
- Current Portfolio: $250,000
- Annual Savings: $45,000
- Investment Return: 7% (optimistic)
- Years to FIRE: (1,250,000 - 250,000) / (45,000 × 0.07) = $1,000,000 / 3,150 = ~317 years

**With Passive Income Acceleration:**
- Passive Income: $10,000/year
- Effective Savings: $45,000 + $10,000 = $55,000
- Years to FIRE: $1,000,000 / (55,000 × 0.07) = $1,000,000 / 3,850 = ~260 years

**With Side Hustle ($15,000/year):**
- Effective Savings: $45,000 + $10,000 + $15,000 = $70,000
- Years to FIRE: $1,000,000 / (70,000 × 0.07) = $1,000,000 / 4,900 = ~204 years

## 5. Tech Worker Salary Optimization

### Optimize Your Income

**1. Remote Work Location (Low Tax)**
- Consider: Costa Rica, Portugal (NHR regime), Thailand (digital nomad)
- Tax Savings: 0-15% vs US/European countries

**2. Negotiate Sign-On Bonuses**
- Ask for: Sign-on bonus, equity, relocation assistance
- Typical Bonus: $5,000-$20,000

**3. Salary Review Timing**
- Negotiate: Every 12-18 months
- Leverage: Job offers from competitors
- Market Value: Research salary ranges for your role/location

### Optimize Your Skills

**1. High-Income Certifications**
- AWS Solutions Architect: $150,000/year+ (average)
- Google Cloud Professional: $145,000/year+ (average)

## 6. Passive Income Acceleration

Passive income dramatically reduces your time to FIRE.

### Tech-Specific Passive Income Streams

**1. Digital Products:**
- Jupyter Notebooks ($19-29 each)
- React Admin Templates ($29-49 each)
- Terraform Modules ($49-99 each)
- Expected Revenue: $500-1,000/month

**2. Micro-SaaS:**
- Developer Tool SaaS: $9-29/month per user
- Project Management SaaS: $5-15/month per seat
- Documentation Platform SaaS: $19-99/month per company
- Expected Revenue: $2,000-10,000/month

**3. API Monetization:**
- Crypto Price Data API: $10.49 per 1,000 calls
- SEO Analysis API: $29.99/month per user
- Expected Revenue: $1,000-3,000/month

**4. Affiliate Marketing:**
- Tech Blog (like coderwealth.com): DigitalOcean referral ($10-50)
- JetBrains Marketplace: 10-20% commission on paid tools
- Expected Revenue: $300-1,000/month

### Example: FIRE Acceleration

**Without Passive Income:**
- Years to FIRE: ~260 years
- Investment Required: $1,000,000

**With $3,000/month Passive Income:**
- Annual Passive Income: $36,000
- Effective Annual Savings: $45,000 + $36,000 = $81,000
- Years to FIRE: $1,000,000 / (81,000 × 0.07) = $1,000,000 / 5,670 = ~177 years

**Result:** Passive income shaved 83 years off your FIRE timeline.

## 7. Withdrawal Rate Strategies

### Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR)

**3-4% SWR:** Recommended for 30+ year horizons.

**Implementation:**
- Withdraw 4% of portfolio first year ($50,000 on $1.25M)
- Adjust for inflation: 3% SWR + 2% inflation = 5% effective
- Rebalance annually to maintain asset allocation

### Variable SWR

**Conservative Years (Bear Markets):** Use 3% SWR
**Neutral Years:** Use 4% SWR
**Growth Years (Bull Markets):** Use 5% SWR

### Sequence of Returns Risk

**Risk:** Selling stocks during down markets depletes portfolio faster than expected.

**Mitigation:**
- Keep 2-3 years of expenses in cash
- Use bonds or fixed income during bear markets
- Delay selling stocks until market recovers

## 8. Asset Allocation for FIRE

### Balanced Portfolio (Aggressive Growth)

| Asset Class | Allocation | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| **US Stocks (S&P 500)** | 40% | Growth engine |
| **International Stocks** | 20% | Diversification |
| **Bonds** | 15% | Stability |
| **Real Estate (REITs)** | 15% | Income + Inflation hedge |
| **Cash** | 10% | Expenses + Emergency Fund |

**ETF Recommendations:**
- US Stocks: VTI or SPY
- International: VXUS or VEU
- Bonds: BND or TLT
- REITs: VNQ or VNQI

### Tech-Worker Allocations

**Since tech workers have higher risk tolerance:**
- Increase US Stocks to 50%
- Reduce Bonds to 10%
- Increase REITs to 20%
- Keep Cash at 10%

**Result:** Aggressive growth allocation with higher expected returns (8-10%/year).

## 9. FIRE Timeline Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Aggressive FIRE (Fastest)

**Assumptions:**
- Salary: $200,000/year (senior engineer)
- Expenses: $60,000/year
- Current Portfolio: $100,000
- Passive Income: $0
- Savings Rate: 60%
- Investment Return: 8%

**Calculation:**
- FIRE Number: $60,000 / 0.04 = $1,500,000
- Years to FIRE: ($1,500,000 - $100,000) / (120,000 × 0.08) = $1,400,000 / 9,600 = ~12.6 years
- FIRE Age: ~40 years old (if currently 27)

### Scenario 2: Balanced FIRE (Recommended)

**Assumptions:**
- Salary: $150,000/year
- Expenses: $50,000/year
- Current Portfolio: $150,000
- Passive Income: $10,000/year
- Savings Rate: 56%
- Investment Return: 7%

**Calculation:**
- FIRE Number: $50,000 / 0.04 = $1,250,000
- Years to FIRE: ($1,250,000 - $150,000) / ((75,000 + 10,000) × 0.07) = $1,100,000 / 5,950 = ~18.5 years
- FIRE Age: ~45 years old (if currently 27)

### Scenario 3: FIRE with Side Hustle

**Assumptions:**
- Salary: $150,000/year
- Expenses: $50,000/year
- Current Portfolio: $150,000
- Passive Income: $30,000/year ($10k blog + $20k side hustle)
- Savings Rate: 76%
- Investment Return: 7%

**Calculation:**
- FIRE Number: $50,000 / 0.04 = $1,250,000
- Years to FIRE: ($1,250,000 - $150,000) / ((75,000 + 30,000) × 0.07) = $1,100,000 / 7,350 = ~15.3 years
- FIRE Age: ~42 years old (if currently 27)

## 10. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Expenses

**Problem:** Not accounting for healthcare costs, taxes, or unexpected expenses.

**Solution:** Track expenses for 3-6 months, calculate FIRE number based on actual spending, not theoretical budgets.

### Mistake 2: Over-Optimistic Investment Returns

**Problem:** Assuming 10%+ annual returns consistently.

**Solution:** Use 7-8% return for conservative planning. Historically, markets have 20-year periods with 5%+ returns.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Inflation

**Problem:** $1 million in 2046 is worth less in 2026 due to inflation.

**Solution:** Include 2-3% inflation in your FIRE number calculation. Use SWR (3-4%) + inflation.

### Mistake 4: Lifestyle Creep

**Problem:** Lifestyle increases as income increases (hedonic treadmill).

**Solution:** Maintain lifestyle (with inflation adjustments) even when salary increases. Invest all raises and bonuses.

### Mistake 5: Not Having Emergency Fund

**Problem:** Market crash forces you to sell investments at low prices.

**Solution:** Keep 6 months of expenses in cash ($25,000 based on $50k/year). Before withdrawing from portfolio.
