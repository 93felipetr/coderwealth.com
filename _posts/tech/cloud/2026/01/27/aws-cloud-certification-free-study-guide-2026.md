## 7. Exam Day Tips

### Before Exam

1. **Sleep 7-8 hours** - Cognitive performance peaks with proper sleep
2. **Eat light meal** - Heavy meals cause drowsiness
3. **Arrive 30 minutes early** - Reduces anxiety, allows setup time
4. **Bring water and snacks** - Brain needs glucose for sustained focus
5. **Valid ID required** - Make sure you have acceptable identification

### During Exam

**Time Management (130 minutes = 65 questions = 2 minutes/question):**

1. **Flag and Return:** If unsure, mark question, return later
2. **Skip Easy Questions First:** Build momentum and confidence quickly
3. **Use Process of Elimination:** Rule out obviously wrong answers
4. **Trust First Instinct:** AWS exams are designed for experts

**Multiple Choice (Multiple Answer):**
- Sometimes you need to select 2 or 3 correct answers
- Scenario: "Which TWO of the following are correct?"
- Don't assume it's only one answer - read the question carefully

**"Select TWO" Questions:**
- These questions are easier than they seem
- Usually test two different concepts
- If you identify one correct answer, the other is often in the same topic area
